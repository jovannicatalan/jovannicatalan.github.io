What do you think being a data scientist is about?

Data Science is the are used to wrangle large amounts of data using statistics. The goal is to answer questions from the business and drive business decisions. Data Scientist must provide business insights from the data they have obtained. Communication and presentation skills are a must in order to communicate with the business.

 

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 

Although the term ‘data science’ is not always well defined, it seems like at a high level this role is used by companies to analyze data to make the best decisions possible given some information and skills needed to interpret that information. Data scientist can also work with machine learning engineers to design and build models to drive or incorporate into some of the products they develop. Some of the main processes a Data Scientist must follow are  ‘data cleansing’, ‘preparation’ and ‘analysis’.

Data scientist usually must have an advanced degree in statistics or a related field and must be good at programming. Skills in R,  SAS, Python, SQL, Scala and object oriented programming are a must among others. They must also have the domain knowledge to know how to apply the above skills in their specific area.

 

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 

I see that data science is a modern version of applied statistics. It combines the statistics, programming and data visualization and presentation skills in order to take large amounts of data and provide business insights or build models to be used within a product. Statistics on the other hand has been around for ages. A statistician doesn’t always need to be good programmer although skills to interpret data are necessary. I feel like statistics is one of the main fundamental areas data science must fall back on, while statistics is an area that can stand on its own. 

 

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

As of now I have good programming skills and am working towards refining my knowledge in the areas of statistics. I have only combined these two areas at a very basic level during class work, so I wouldn’t call myself a data scientist yet! I think a ‘Data Scientist’ is a label reserved usually for people at a large company working with large amounts of data to extract useful information from that data. I have only just touched small pieces of the data science world.
