# Blog Post 5: R

__What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward? 
Why or why not?__

I think that R are is very useful for data science. In this course we were able to use R for reading data from different formats.
We were able to manipulate the data and provide both numberical and graphical summaries. We were also able to learn to use many
different models including, linear regression models, generalized linear models, tree models and ensemeble methods as well.
We were able to compare models againts each other, split data and even use cross-validation. I feel like this is the basis for
data science and therefore makes R a good tool for data science. I do plan to use R going forward, especially since I plan on 
taking machine learning courses that make use of R. I also plan on going into machine learning as part of my career where R
is very popular.

__What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?__

I think I will dig deeper into data science and machine learning after having taking this course. It's something that has
really drawn my interest and think I would wan to continue doing going forward.

__What areas of statistics/data science are you thinking about exploring further?__

As mentioned above machine learning is what I want to dig deeper into and explore further. I want to take more courses
on this topic and even make it part of my career.
