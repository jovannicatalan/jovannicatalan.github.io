## Propmt Response

I like R. I think it is a specific statistical software tool and doesn’t
try to get into other areas of software that I know of. With R it’s easy
to just load a dataset and convert it into a dataframe and get any type
of summary fairly easily. There really isn’t much I miss about other
software languages within R. I R is a statistical tool and does
everything around that. You get the data do what you want with and can
even knit it to pdf/html with images and text. I feel like it’s simple
and easy to learn, except for the plots and graphs since they have some
many options.

## Example R Markdown output

``` r
plot(iris)
```
