## Project 2 Description:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the online news popularity data set choose some predictive variables and create some numerical and graphical summaries based on those variables. We will fit both linear and ensemble regression models and compare the results to see which model performs the best using RMSE.
We will also use report automation to generate individual reports for each data channel from the dataset. We first would split the data by data channel and proceed from there.

### What would you do differently?  
I would probably try to read through the instructions a few times before starting to make sure I had a clear understanding of  
all of the requirments. That way I wouldn't have to back and update the markdown file as much as I did because I kept going 
back and forth and re-reading the instructions and finding out I still had something left to do.

### what was the most difficult part for you?
Trying to get the render code to work was a real challenge for me. Specifically getting the parameter from the render code 
to be used to generate the individual reports from within the R markdown fie. This part required a lot of research and was 
just very time consuming.

### what are your big take-aways from this project?
I think that in the end I learned something very useful. It would take a long time to try to generate each individual report 
manually and this simplifies the process a lot. It also provides the needed consitency across the reports that way the only 
thing being compared across the reports are the intentended data channels.
